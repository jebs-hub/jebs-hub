My name is JÃ©ssica, I'm 20 and I'm in the third computer engineering period at University of Campinas. 
So far, I had a little contact with the programming world, so I dont't have an especific activity area.
I'm very interested in learning and studying, so I started to make little projects using Recat Native, React JS and other tools releted with app and web development. 
I also learned a bit of python, C and JS. 
For now, I'm focoused in finishing my basic cycle semesters and learning foudantions concepts in computer science. After that, I hope to see a big picture about my interests and start building larger and more complex projects.
My intention is to share projects made by me and see how I'm developing as a programmer.
